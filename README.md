# 🌿 **Plastic Waste Classification Using CNN**  

## 🌟 **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on developing a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images of plastic waste into different categories such as ♻️ **Recyclable** and 🌱 **Organic**. The dataset is sourced from **Kaggle**, containing labeled images structured into separate folders for training and testing.
